# How to play:
Use the d-pad to draw pixels to the DRC, press A to cycle through the colors. The current color will be shown on the TV.

# Installation:
.elf, .rpx, and .wuhb files are in the releases tab, if you wish you can manually compile the game by running these commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/misterfonka/DrawU
cd DrawU
make # Make sure you have wut and devkitPro installed
```

Once you have obtained the file for your CFW, move it over to SD:/wiiu/apps/
